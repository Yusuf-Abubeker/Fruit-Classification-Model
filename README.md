# Fruit Classification Model

Welcome to the Fruit Classification Model repository! This project is a class project aimed at classifying different types of fruits using a deep learning model built with Python Keras. Additionally, a web interface has been developed using ReactJS, allowing users to upload fruit images and receive predicted classes.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture implemented with Keras, a high-level neural networks API, to classify various types of fruits. The model has been trained on a dataset consisting of labeled fruit images to learn the distinguishing features of different fruits.

## Usage

To use the fruit classification model, simply visit the [web interface](https://fruit-classification-model.vercel.app/), where you can upload images of fruits. The model will then predict the class of the fruit depicted in the image.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The model is built using Python, leveraging the Keras library for deep learning.
- **ReactJS**: The web interface is developed using ReactJS, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is used as the backend for Keras, providing efficient computation for training and inference.
- **Vercel**: The web application is deployed on Vercel, providing a seamless hosting solution.
